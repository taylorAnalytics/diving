# diving
This is my second app. I was trying to accomplish two things:
1) have it be a bigger scale application
2) be more advanced in terms of the PHP use

As for the PHP use, I was trying to do the following:
- I learned & implemented for the first time the OOP. The classes are still the representation of real life things (which I know now
should not be the case, at least not always), but they have their methods and properties. I still could not get the hang of why
some of them should be private, protected or public, so I guess most of them are public
- the scale of the app required more php functionalities, such as managing files, etc.

As for the scale, the app would cover:
- a wider range of user types & access control based on it - if you register as an instructor you get to have different functionalities
compared to a dive shop
- an editable diver/instructor/shop profile
- picture galleries - creating, editing, viewing & searching
- blog management - creating a post, editing it, submitting it, bookmarking it
- dive trips - a combination of a gallery with a trip description & a plan for it (including bookmarked articles)
- a job search engine for the instructors (no coded here, it was just a concept)
