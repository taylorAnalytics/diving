/* The purpose of this script is to show the details of the dive shop. It will:
 * - create the object of class DiveShop
 * - retrieve all the information from the mysql database using the object methods
 * - present the informations within particular sections: basic info, recreational course prices, professional prices, fun diving prices, galleries, articles written, anything else?
 * - have the options to do something with the dive shop: add to an existing trip, bookmark a gallery (an option that is not existent yet), add the dive shop to the planned trip (again, an option not existing yet)
